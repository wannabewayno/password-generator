### Pass-phrasing

The aim of the website is to allow the user to get up-to-speed with the current password guidelines.
After familiarising themselves with the information provided, they are prompted to generate a pass-phrase using the javascript based generator.

The password generator uses the diceware method by randomly generating numbers and assigning them to words with a look-up-table. The user can specify further if they want this pass-phrase to be jumbled with numbers or special characters to increase security, however by generally reducing memorization.
