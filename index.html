                Password guidelines for 2020 and beyond

            <hr>
            <p>
                New password guidelines for the digital-age heavily rely on two principles.
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Password Length
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Memorising your password
                    </li>
                </ol>
                Is that it? - yeah pretty much
            </p>
            <p>
                The last 30 years of enterprise level computing has taught us a few lessons.
                Foremost the most important one to take home is that we're really bad at making passwords.
                Let's go through a few common myths about creating strong passwords and why the new guidelines don't use them.

                <dl>
                    <dt>
                        <h6>
                            Forcing users to frequently change their passwords.
                        </h6>
                        <dd>
                            <p>
                                Most businesses, corporations, schools/universities do this to increase secruity. Makes sense, but does it?
                            In reality - <em>no</em>. Changing your password regularly is a chore; it's painful and annoying and most users simply end up resorting to using the same password with a suffix on the end "davidmycat1, davidmycat3 etc..". 
                            The result of this forced rotation ends up with users having the same predictable password across the board, nice job.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This result is contradictory to making your password memorable if you do actually change your password to a new unique word and<em> then </em>have to change this<em> all </em>the time.
                            Which unique password is the new one again? "car_myboatrules3"? or "drowssaph4h4guessthis"? or perhaps the other 5 I've used. It's a productivity killer.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Another reason as to why they force users to rotate, is to reduce the time that an exposed password could be linked to the system. Again, if a breach were to happen, attackers don't sit on this information for weeks/months/years. It's acted upon in hours and all information that they can glean
                                has already happened regardless of rotation frequency.
                            </p> 
                        </dd>
                    </dt>
                    <dt>
                        <h6>
                            The use of special characters
                        </h6>
                        <dd>
                            <p>
                            Having a heap of special characters theoretically makes your password stronger, yes. However it usually contradicts the old "making it memorable clause" again.
                            The use of special characters is sometimes also specific to what service your using, and some restrict the use of certain characters, resulting in headaches remembering what ones you can and can't use.
                            In general, the allowed list (in double quotations) are " !"#$%&amp;'()*+,-./:;&lt;=&gt;?@[\]^_`{|}~". 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            So theoretically yes? But why not?
                            Well let's take these two simple examples, "@muzik$" &amp; "agreeable". the first example uses special characters, giving a potential attacker a hard time by accounting for an extra 33 characters on top of the already 26 (from the alphabet)
                            The second option only has 26 characters to choose from for each character. The first example has roughly 2,500 Billion combinations, the second? - 5,400 Billion. 
                            I'll let you decide which one is more memorable, which at the end of the day is important, otherwise your password is useless.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Another interesting point to note is that a potential password<em> could </em> contain special characters. The attacker doesn't know if your password does or not, so they have to assume that they do.
                            Hence from the example above, your memorable password will also be treated as if it might contain special characters. Bumping up the amount of possible combinations to 8,600 <strong>trillion</strong>. And yet it's still memorable.
                            Now you might be thinking, they could use the alphabet first, if that returns no hits then include special characters. And you're right, so the lesson here is length is everything, and the bonus is that if they do look for special characters... you're streets ahead already.
                            </p>
                        </dd>
                    </dt>
                    <dt>
                        <h6>
                            1337 Speak (<em>leet speak</em>)
                        </h6>
                        <dd>
                            This is very much the same as the special character argument, however only a few letters have number comparisons, and look up tables exist for common passwords with leet speak in them... This doesn't really make your password any stronger and again, it's harder to remember than plain english. In reality to achieve numbers in your password, people tend to just add them at the end (like rotated passwords); Guess what, if you know this, so do attackers everywhere and they have smarter algorithms that target this mindset.
                            So I'll leave it there.

            <h3>
                New Password Guidelines
            </h3>
            <p>
                Ok, so back to the two principles, password length, password memorability.
                This can be done easily by changing the concept of a pass<em>word</em> to a pass<em>phrase</em>.
                <blockquote>
                    What is a Passphrase?
                </blockquote>
                I'm glad you asked, it's a string of words put together in a way that you can remember.
                being a phrase, it's long, uses a hiphen to join words together (adding some special charcter magic) and is very memorable.
                <blockquote>
                    Example "the-dog-will-hunt"
                </blockquote> 
                That puppy right there is really easy to remember and has a whopping the age-of-the-universe amount of combinations due to that 17 letter string, nice right?
                So this Site will allow you to generate a pass-phrase that will hopefully be memorable for you. See the next section on how to use this site <i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i>

            <h4>
                The Diceware method
            </h4>
            <hr>
            <p>
                This method typically uses 5 dice to generate a 5-digit random number. This number corresponds to a word in an associated look-up-table. 
                You generate as many numbers as words you want. 
            </p>
            <p>
                For example: You roll 5 dice and get the numbers 4-2-3-1-1, this would be the number "42311", and in the english look-up-table this number corresponds to the word "nuzzle".
                You can do this 3 more times and get nuzzle-diligent-outmost-patchy, a 30 character passphrase. Arrange the words around to find the easiest way to memorise this passphrase.
                I would proably use, diligent-nuzzle-outmost-patchy. To me it sounds like "a diligent nuzzle is outmost patchy" or something to that extent.
            </p>
            <p>
                This site uses javascript to generate a random number that corresponds to a word in the various look-up-tables provided and string them together to give you a passphase.
